# -VHDL-PROCESSOR-RISK
Multi-cycle Processor Design and Hardware Implementation with RISC Architecture.
This processor was designed with RISC architecture using vhdl language. 
In addition, Vivado program was used for synthesis operations and loading to FPGA.
These codes here in github, are just the vhdl and wave files.
Before using Vivado, the design of the processor, the instruction lists, the registers to be used and the number of bits were determined. Additionally, these identified designs are shown below.
The waveforms in the simulation results are specified in the files.
